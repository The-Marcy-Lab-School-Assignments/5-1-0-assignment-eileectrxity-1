# Question 1

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
In object-oriented programming, a class definition can hold both instance properties/methods and class (static) properties/methods.

**Instance properties and methods** are specific to each instance of a class and are accessed/called through their instance name, represented by the `this` keyword. They allow each instance object to manage its own state and behavior independently.

**Class properties and methods** (also called static methods), on the other hand, belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance. This means their values are shared across all instances of the class and can *only* be accessed directly through the class name.

The difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are **created** is that class methods/properties are created using the `static` keyword while instance methods/properties are not.

To be more specific:

- Instance properties are created within the constructor function using the `this` keyword. Meanwhile, instance methods are defined within the class body, also using `this` to access/modify instance properties.
- Class properties are not defined within the constructor function because they are not specific to any instance. Instead, they are defined at the class level within the class body. Meanwhile, class methods are also defined within the class body, using the class name itself to access/modify class properties.

The difference between how they're **used** is that instance methods and properties deal with data and behavior specific to individual objects instantiated from a class. In contrast, class/static methods and properties deal with data common to all instances of a class. They are generally used for functionality that does not depend on instance-specific data but is relevant to the class as a whole- they forego the need to have an instance at all.
